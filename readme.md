## Löydä lähde (Find a spring)

A website to gather and present data about the naturally occurring springs in Finland. Includes a RESTful api to be exposed to 
a companion mobile app. Location data is to be stored as PostgreSQL postgis extension data, which enables spatial features,
such as distance calculations.

One possible goal is to activate and empower people to care for their local
water supplies and spread awareness about them.
